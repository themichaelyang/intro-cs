# An Integrated Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

## Goals
We want to..
1. Be able to think computationally and apply computational thinking to problem solving.
2. Be able to read, write, and design effective programs.
3. Understand, at a high level, what a computer and programs are doing.
4. Understand and be able to apply basic data structures, algorithms, and design paradigms (and how to measure their efficiency/effectiveness).
5. Understand the importance and applications of computer science.

## Topics

## Outline
- Motivations + applications, goals of the course + why?, honor code
- CS vs Programming/Coding (semantics) <sup>[MIT1]</sup> <sup>[MIT2]</sup>
- What is a computer? What is it doing? What is software, and what is it doing? High level overview of model of computation.
- Computers are very literal, and will only do what you tell them to do, and do it exactly. Programming languages have a very strict grammer and vocabulary: syntax. <sup>[MIT1]</sup> <sup>[MIT2]</sup>
- Memory Model (pointers?)
- Computers and programs as: Inputs -> Data -> Transforming Data -> Output, Interfacing
- Data I: Fixed Size Data <sup>[HTDP]</sup>
  - const
  - Base data types: Number, Boolean, String
  - abstract data definitions
- Comments
- Modifying data I:
  - Base operations: Arithmetic, etc...
- Printing, Terminal, REPL
- Modifying data II: Functions (review pointer model)
  - lambda functions
  - Composing basic operations
  - Built-in functions
  - Function closures
  - comments and function signatures
- Control Flow I: if + else
- Boolean Operations:
  - not, and, or, xor, implies(?)
  - Basic properties, Demorgan's
  - Truth tables
  - Reducing truth table to boolean formula <sup>[bool1]</sup> <sup>[bool2]</sup>
- Data II: Custom Data
  - Objects as structs
  - Designing predicates, validators
- Data III: Arbitrarily Large Data <sup>[HTDP]</sup>
  - Linked Lists
- Control Flow II: Recursion
